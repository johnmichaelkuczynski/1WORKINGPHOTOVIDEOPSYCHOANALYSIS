## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity
- **Analysis Services**: AWS Rekognition, Face++
- **Email**: SendGrid
- **Storage**: In-memory with session management

## Project Architecture
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend with API routes
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- Session-based analysis storage with proper clearing functionality

## User Preferences
- Prefers simple, everyday language in communications
- Values working solutions over technical explanations
- Needs comprehensive testing of new features
- Wants clean state management (no stacking of old analyses)

## Recent Changes
### January 2025
- **Fixed session clearing**: Added server-side session clearing to prevent analyses from stacking up when using "New Analysis" button
- **Enhanced "New Analysis" functionality**: Button now properly creates fresh sessions with clean state
- **Added session management endpoints**: `/api/session/clear` and related endpoints for proper session handling
- **Verified email sharing**: SendGrid integration working properly with all required API credentials
- **Confirmed re-analysis capability**: Users can analyze same content with different AI models
- **All AI services connected**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, AWS Rekognition, Face++ all working
- **Fixed text analysis bug**: Resolved "[object Object]" display issue in text analysis results
- **Removed markdown formatting**: Cleaned up all analysis outputs to remove # and * symbols
- **Updated AI model display names**: Changed to 知 1 (Anthropic), 知 2 (OpenAI), 知 3 (DeepSeek), 知 4 (Perplexity) using Chinese character for "knowledge"
- **Fixed dropdown order**: Models now display in correct 知 1-4 sequence
- **Implemented Chinese character**: Used authentic "知" character for elegant model naming
- **Fixed text analysis formatting**: Removed raw JSON code display, now shows clean readable text output
- **Fixed DeepSeek validation**: Added "deepseek" to backend validation schemas to enable 知 3 for all analysis types
- **CRITICAL FIX - Face detection accuracy**: Added 90% confidence threshold filter to AWS Rekognition to eliminate false positives (shadows, reflections, background elements)
- **CRITICAL FIX - Grounded analysis**: AI prompts now receive structured visual data (age, gender, emotions, facial features) instead of raw JSON
- **CRITICAL FIX - Scene context**: Added AWS DetectLabels to identify objects/scenes in photos (e.g., piano, musical instrument) for contextual analysis
- **CRITICAL FIX - Fabrication prevention**: AI explicitly instructed to base analysis only on actual visual data, not fabricate details
