MBTI PROTOCOL VIDEO 

I. Introversion vs Extraversion (I/E)

Does their energy seem directed outward (projected), or inward (contained, self-referential)?

Do they initiate interaction with surroundings/others—or wait, observe, respond?

How quickly and confidently do they make eye contact with the camera/person—or do they glance briefly or avoid it?

Are their gestures expansive and socially open—or minimized, controlled, and self-contained?

Does their posture lean forward/engage—or stay anchored inward/backward, conserving energy?

II. Sensing vs Intuition (S/N)

Do they tangibly engage with their physical surroundings—or appear mentally elsewhere, focused on ideas more than environment?

Is their attention visibly grounded in the present moment—or drifting, future-oriented, symbolic, or associative?

When interacting, do their eyes scan concrete objects—or look up/aside as if accessing concepts or abstractions?

Are movements literal and practical—or stylized, metaphorical, or imaginative?

Do they respond to immediate sensory input—or to internal interpretations of what could be happening?

III. Thinking vs Feeling (T/F)

Are facial reactions emotionally transparent—or filtered through analysis and composure?

When reacting, do they first show empathy/connection—or evaluation/judgment/assessment?

Do they adjust their posture and movements to maintain harmony—or to maintain logical structure and control?

Are emotional expressions fluid and relational—or subtle, contained, or dampened?

If speaking, do they choose words that connect emotionally—or words that systematize or clarify?

IV. Judging vs Perceiving (J/P)

Is their movement precise, planned, and concluded—or adaptive, flexible, and open-ended?

Do they complete motions cleanly—or leave gestures half-open, unresolved?

Are facial expressions decisive and consistent—or quickly changing, context-responsive?

Do they anticipate and prepare for things before they happen—or react in-the-moment?

Does their timing feel structured and rhythmic—or spontaneous and elastic?

V. Deeper Cognitive Function Signals

Do they show sustained focus on one point (Ni/Si)—or rapid shifting and idea-generation (Ne/Se)?

Are emotional responses internalized (Fi) or immediately externalized toward others (Fe)?

Do they use small, precise gestures (Ti/Si)—or broad, audience-aware ones (Fe/Se)?

Is their speaking cadence clipped, sequential, and controlled—or flowing, adaptive, meandering?

Do they pause to evaluate before acting—or act first and adjust afterward?

Do they correct or adjust the environment (J)—or assimilate themselves into it (P)?

Is their facial micro-expression delayed (inward processing) or immediate (external processing)?

Do they show tension to maintain control—or relaxed adaptability to emerging stimuli?

Does their energy rise the longer they engage (E/Ne/Se)—or deplete or pull inward (I/Ni/Si)?

If surprised, do they freeze and process—or respond instantly and externally?
