ADD THREE FUNCTIONS: MBTI FOR TEXT/PHOTO/VIDEO
THESE ARE TO BE ADDITIONAL TO, NOT INSTEAD OF, EXISTING FUNCTION. 
YOU ARE TO CREATE THREE NEW BUTTONS. 

MBTI PROTOCOL FOR TEXT: 

WHEN RUNNING THE MBTI FUNCTION ON TEXT, THE APP MUST ASK THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH A GIVEN TEXT: 


I. Introversion vs Extraversion

Does the text emphasize inner thoughts and reflection, or external events and social interaction?

Is the author more focused on subjective experience (“I think/feel”) or shared/group dynamics (“we,” “people”)?

Does the work explore solitude, retreat, and internal processing—or engagement, action, or outward expression?

Are ideas developed internally and abstractly—or through dialogue, examples, and external interactions?

Is emotional expression restrained and implied—or direct, open, and outwardly engaged?

II. Sensing vs Intuition

Does the writing focus on concrete details, sensory description, and observable facts (S) or possibilities, patterns, and abstractions (N)?

Are examples literal and rooted in physical experience—or metaphoric, symbolic, or hypothetical?

Does the author favor step-by-step description—or leaps to conceptual insight and synthesis?

Are time, sequence, and practical procedures emphasized—or timeless principles and overarching meaning?

Does the author show trust in past experience and tradition—or interest in innovation, speculation, and potential futures?

III. Thinking vs Feeling

Is the reasoning structured around logic, consistency, and objective principles—or values, ethics, and human impact?

Does the author handle disagreement through argument and critique—or through empathy, harmony, and relational tone?

Are judgments justified by cause-and-effect reasoning—or by moral relevance and personal meaning?

Does the text prioritize truth over tone—or tone over blunt accuracy?

Are emotions analyzed as data—or used as persuasive elements tied to human wellbeing?

IV. Judging vs Perceiving

Is the structure of the writing tight, organized, and conclusive—or open-ended, exploratory, and flexible?

Does the author express certainty and closure—or ambiguity and willingness to leave questions unresolved?

Is time handled with plans, deadlines, and deliberate pacing—or spontaneity and fluid transitions?

Are definitions fixed and categories stable—or shifting, provisional, and context-dependent?

Does the argument move linearly toward conclusions—or circle, revise, and adapt as it unfolds?

V. Deeper Indirect MBTI Signals

Does the text show preference for systemic analysis—or narrative, emotional resonance?

Are values universalized and principled—or personal and relational?

Does the author rely on internal intuition (private insight) or external data and observation?

Is conflict treated as a problem to solve logically—or to reconcile interpersonally?

Does the work prioritize control, predictability, and structure—or openness to uncertainty and adaptation?

Is language precise and utilitarian—or expressive, aesthetic, or symbolic?

Does the narrative voice depend on established rules—or break conventions playfully or freely?

Are future possibilities extrapolated logically—or imagined freely and creatively?

Do characters (or the narrator) suppress personal feelings to maintain objectivity—or elevate emotional truth?

Is the tone disciplined and purposeful—or improvisational and fluid?


MBTI PROTOCOL IMAGES 


I. Introversion vs Extraversion (I/E)

Does the person's facial expression convey self-restraint, inward focus, and minimal performative energy—or open expressiveness and outward emotional broadcast?

Is eye contact direct and socially assertive—or indirect, introspective, or observing rather than engaging?

Are they alone or with others, and if with others, are they positioned as focal point or quiet participant?

Does their body posture project “closed” (arms in, shoulders inward) or “open” (expanded, outward-facing)?

Is the environment suggestive of solitude, study, or quiet spaces—or public, energetic, and socially dynamic?

II. Sensing vs Intuition (S/N)

Are clothes and accessories practical, detail-oriented, and sensory-specific—or symbolic, abstract, or stylistically conceptual?

Is the person’s gaze locked into the environment (grounded) or slightly distant/"elsewhere" (abstracted)?

Do facial micro-expressions show direct reaction to physical surroundings—or inward processing of ideas?

Is the environment filled with literal objects/tools—or symbolic/artistic/ambiguous elements?

Does the person's styling emphasize texture, material precision, and concreteness—or originality, metaphor, or thematic coherence?

III. Thinking vs Feeling (T/F)

Does the expression suggest emotional attunement and warmth—or analysis, restraint, and evaluative distance?

Are facial muscles relaxed and receptive—or tense near brows/jaw, as if organizing or assessing?

Is posture soft and adaptable—or structured, controlled, and deliberate?

Is there visual evidence of values-driven identity (causes, humanitarian symbols)—or system/logic-driven identity (devices, strategy games, tools)?

Is the overall emotional atmosphere personal and empathetic—or impersonal, technical, and principled?

IV. Judging vs Perceiving (J/P)

Are clothes symmetrical, ironed, and intentionally arranged—or more relaxed, mismatched, or improvisational?

Does the photo composition show order and planning—or spontaneity and flow?

Is the posture upright and resolved—or loose, adaptable, and mid-transition?

Does the setting suggest schedules, structure, and completion—or exploration, activity, or ongoing process?

Are facial expressions “settled” and decisive—or flexible, shifting, or open-ended?

V. Cognitive / Deeper Indicators

Does the person occupy space confidently and definitively—or lightly, as if moving through possibilities?

Are their hands used in expressive, relational ways—or instrumental, precise, or still?

Do they display intense, narrow-focus gaze (Ni/Si) or scanning/observing multiple cues (Ne/Se)?

Is the environment curated for meaning/symbolism—or for function, utility, or familiarity?

Are emotional cues projected outward (Fe)—or held internally (Fi), visible only subtly around the eyes/mouth?

Does the image show harmony-seeking positioning near others—or independence and self-contained space?

Does the person appear to structure their environment—or adapt fluidly to it?

Are they visually aligned with tradition and convention—or personalized, unconventional, or experimental?

Does their body language appear measured and restrained—or reactive and environment-responsive?

Is their aesthetic intentional and minimal—or layered, evolving, and exploratory?


MBTI PROTOCOL VIDEO 

I. Introversion vs Extraversion (I/E)

Does their energy seem directed outward (projected), or inward (contained, self-referential)?

Do they initiate interaction with surroundings/others—or wait, observe, respond?

How quickly and confidently do they make eye contact with the camera/person—or do they glance briefly or avoid it?

Are their gestures expansive and socially open—or minimized, controlled, and self-contained?

Does their posture lean forward/engage—or stay anchored inward/backward, conserving energy?

II. Sensing vs Intuition (S/N)

Do they tangibly engage with their physical surroundings—or appear mentally elsewhere, focused on ideas more than environment?

Is their attention visibly grounded in the present moment—or drifting, future-oriented, symbolic, or associative?

When interacting, do their eyes scan concrete objects—or look up/aside as if accessing concepts or abstractions?

Are movements literal and practical—or stylized, metaphorical, or imaginative?

Do they respond to immediate sensory input—or to internal interpretations of what could be happening?

III. Thinking vs Feeling (T/F)

Are facial reactions emotionally transparent—or filtered through analysis and composure?

When reacting, do they first show empathy/connection—or evaluation/judgment/assessment?

Do they adjust their posture and movements to maintain harmony—or to maintain logical structure and control?

Are emotional expressions fluid and relational—or subtle, contained, or dampened?

If speaking, do they choose words that connect emotionally—or words that systematize or clarify?

IV. Judging vs Perceiving (J/P)

Is their movement precise, planned, and concluded—or adaptive, flexible, and open-ended?

Do they complete motions cleanly—or leave gestures half-open, unresolved?

Are facial expressions decisive and consistent—or quickly changing, context-responsive?

Do they anticipate and prepare for things before they happen—or react in-the-moment?

Does their timing feel structured and rhythmic—or spontaneous and elastic?

V. Deeper Cognitive Function Signals

Do they show sustained focus on one point (Ni/Si)—or rapid shifting and idea-generation (Ne/Se)?

Are emotional responses internalized (Fi) or immediately externalized toward others (Fe)?

Do they use small, precise gestures (Ti/Si)—or broad, audience-aware ones (Fe/Se)?

Is their speaking cadence clipped, sequential, and controlled—or flowing, adaptive, meandering?

Do they pause to evaluate before acting—or act first and adjust afterward?

Do they correct or adjust the environment (J)—or assimilate themselves into it (P)?

Is their facial micro-expression delayed (inward processing) or immediate (external processing)?

Do they show tension to maintain control—or relaxed adaptability to emerging stimuli?

Does their energy rise the longer they engage (E/Ne/Se)—or deplete or pull inward (I/Ni/Si)?

If surprised, do they freeze and process—or respond instantly and externally?
