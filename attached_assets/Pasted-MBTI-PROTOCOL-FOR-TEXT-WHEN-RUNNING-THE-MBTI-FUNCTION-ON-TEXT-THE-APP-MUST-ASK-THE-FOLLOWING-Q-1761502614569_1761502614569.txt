MBTI PROTOCOL FOR TEXT: 

WHEN RUNNING THE MBTI FUNCTION ON TEXT, THE APP MUST ASK THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH A GIVEN TEXT: 


I. Introversion vs Extraversion

Does the text emphasize inner thoughts and reflection, or external events and social interaction?

Is the author more focused on subjective experience (“I think/feel”) or shared/group dynamics (“we,” “people”)?

Does the work explore solitude, retreat, and internal processing—or engagement, action, or outward expression?

Are ideas developed internally and abstractly—or through dialogue, examples, and external interactions?

Is emotional expression restrained and implied—or direct, open, and outwardly engaged?

II. Sensing vs Intuition

Does the writing focus on concrete details, sensory description, and observable facts (S) or possibilities, patterns, and abstractions (N)?

Are examples literal and rooted in physical experience—or metaphoric, symbolic, or hypothetical?

Does the author favor step-by-step description—or leaps to conceptual insight and synthesis?

Are time, sequence, and practical procedures emphasized—or timeless principles and overarching meaning?

Does the author show trust in past experience and tradition—or interest in innovation, speculation, and potential futures?

III. Thinking vs Feeling

Is the reasoning structured around logic, consistency, and objective principles—or values, ethics, and human impact?

Does the author handle disagreement through argument and critique—or through empathy, harmony, and relational tone?

Are judgments justified by cause-and-effect reasoning—or by moral relevance and personal meaning?

Does the text prioritize truth over tone—or tone over blunt accuracy?

Are emotions analyzed as data—or used as persuasive elements tied to human wellbeing?

IV. Judging vs Perceiving

Is the structure of the writing tight, organized, and conclusive—or open-ended, exploratory, and flexible?

Does the author express certainty and closure—or ambiguity and willingness to leave questions unresolved?

Is time handled with plans, deadlines, and deliberate pacing—or spontaneity and fluid transitions?

Are definitions fixed and categories stable—or shifting, provisional, and context-dependent?

Does the argument move linearly toward conclusions—or circle, revise, and adapt as it unfolds?

V. Deeper Indirect MBTI Signals

Does the text show preference for systemic analysis—or narrative, emotional resonance?

Are values universalized and principled—or personal and relational?

Does the author rely on internal intuition (private insight) or external data and observation?

Is conflict treated as a problem to solve logically—or to reconcile interpersonally?

Does the work prioritize control, predictability, and structure—or openness to uncertainty and adaptation?

Is language precise and utilitarian—or expressive, aesthetic, or symbolic?

Does the narrative voice depend on established rules—or break conventions playfully or freely?

Are future possibilities extrapolated logically—or imagined freely and creatively?

Do characters (or the narrator) suppress personal feelings to maintain objectivity—or elevate emotional truth?

Is the tone disciplined and purposeful—or improvisational and fluid?
