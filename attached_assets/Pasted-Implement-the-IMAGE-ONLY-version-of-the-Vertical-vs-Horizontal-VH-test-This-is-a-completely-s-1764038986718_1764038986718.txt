Implement the IMAGE-ONLY version of the Vertical vs. Horizontal (VH) test.

This is a completely separate module from the text VH test. It receives ONLY an image (photo of a person or their environment) and returns a Vertical/Horizontal score based on visual cues alone – no OCR, no captions, no text overlay.

CORE VISUAL DIAGNOSTICS (hard-coded, never change):

VERTICAL cues (higher score when present and dominant):
- High-contrast lighting from above or single dramatic light source (chiaroscuro)
- Strong vertical lines in frame (columns, thrones, swords upright, mountain backdrops)
- Subject looking upward or into extreme distance
- Cold color palette (steel blue, black, white, gold)
- Symbols of rank or transcendence: crowns, halos, eagles, mountain peaks, weapons held high, solitary elevated position
- Rigid, symmetrical, statuesque posture
- Minimal or no background clutter
- Eyes intense, unblinking, or half-closed in contemplation
- Dark, severe, or ceremonial clothing

HORIZONTAL cues (higher score when present and dominant):
- Soft, even, warm lighting
- Rounded furniture, cushions, plants, cozy clutter
- Subject smiling broadly, head tilted, eyes making direct “connect” gaze at camera
- Domestic setting (bed, couch, kitchen, family photos)
- Casual, loose, colorful or pastel clothing
- Presence of pets, children, food, blankets
- Symmetrical smile + visible teeth
- Background contains many personal items, posters, knick-knacks
- Leaning in, open palms, relaxed slouch

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Create a new function  
`analyze_vertical_horizontal_image(image_bytes) -> dict`

Return exactly this JSON:
```json
{
  "vertical_score": 0.XX,
  "horizontal_score": 0.XX,
  "orientation": "Vertical" | "Horizontal" | "Neutral",
  "dominant_mode": "Extreme Vertical" | "Strong Vertical" | "Moderate Vertical" | "Neutral" | "Moderate Horizontal" | "Strong Horizontal" | "Extreme Horizontal",
  "top_visual_markers_vertical": [...],   // max 6 strings
  "top_visual_markers_horizontal": [...]  // max 6 strings
