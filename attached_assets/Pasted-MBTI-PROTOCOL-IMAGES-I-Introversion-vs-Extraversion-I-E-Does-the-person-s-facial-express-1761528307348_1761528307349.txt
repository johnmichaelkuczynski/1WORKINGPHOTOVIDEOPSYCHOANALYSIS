MBTI PROTOCOL IMAGES 


I. Introversion vs Extraversion (I/E)

Does the person's facial expression convey self-restraint, inward focus, and minimal performative energy—or open expressiveness and outward emotional broadcast?

Is eye contact direct and socially assertive—or indirect, introspective, or observing rather than engaging?

Are they alone or with others, and if with others, are they positioned as focal point or quiet participant?

Does their body posture project “closed” (arms in, shoulders inward) or “open” (expanded, outward-facing)?

Is the environment suggestive of solitude, study, or quiet spaces—or public, energetic, and socially dynamic?

II. Sensing vs Intuition (S/N)

Are clothes and accessories practical, detail-oriented, and sensory-specific—or symbolic, abstract, or stylistically conceptual?

Is the person’s gaze locked into the environment (grounded) or slightly distant/"elsewhere" (abstracted)?

Do facial micro-expressions show direct reaction to physical surroundings—or inward processing of ideas?

Is the environment filled with literal objects/tools—or symbolic/artistic/ambiguous elements?

Does the person's styling emphasize texture, material precision, and concreteness—or originality, metaphor, or thematic coherence?

III. Thinking vs Feeling (T/F)

Does the expression suggest emotional attunement and warmth—or analysis, restraint, and evaluative distance?

Are facial muscles relaxed and receptive—or tense near brows/jaw, as if organizing or assessing?

Is posture soft and adaptable—or structured, controlled, and deliberate?

Is there visual evidence of values-driven identity (causes, humanitarian symbols)—or system/logic-driven identity (devices, strategy games, tools)?

Is the overall emotional atmosphere personal and empathetic—or impersonal, technical, and principled?

IV. Judging vs Perceiving (J/P)

Are clothes symmetrical, ironed, and intentionally arranged—or more relaxed, mismatched, or improvisational?

Does the photo composition show order and planning—or spontaneity and flow?

Is the posture upright and resolved—or loose, adaptable, and mid-transition?

Does the setting suggest schedules, structure, and completion—or exploration, activity, or ongoing process?

Are facial expressions “settled” and decisive—or flexible, shifting, or open-ended?

V. Cognitive / Deeper Indicators

Does the person occupy space confidently and definitively—or lightly, as if moving through possibilities?

Are their hands used in expressive, relational ways—or instrumental, precise, or still?

Do they display intense, narrow-focus gaze (Ni/Si) or scanning/observing multiple cues (Ne/Se)?

Is the environment curated for meaning/symbolism—or for function, utility, or familiarity?

Are emotional cues projected outward (Fe)—or held internally (Fi), visible only subtly around the eyes/mouth?

Does the image show harmony-seeking positioning near others—or independence and self-contained space?

Does the person appear to structure their environment—or adapt fluidly to it?

Are they visually aligned with tradition and convention—or personalized, unconventional, or experimental?

Does their body language appear measured and restrained—or reactive and environment-responsive?

Is their aesthetic intentional and minimal—or layered, evolving, and exploratory?
